## GIPHY App Description

This app uses the [GIPHY API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/sdk) to source gifs for whatever topic you'd like. 
It has a UEFA Champions League theme, prepopulated with buttons for many of the world's best football clubs. Don't see your favorite club? Simply type it in and add your own button.

Not a soccer fan? That's okay, you can search for anything you'd like and the GIPHY app will find the top 10 gifs for you.
